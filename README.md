BackupPan
=========

BackupPan is an OSX client for BaiduCloud. If you use BaiduCloud only for backup, and don't want to sync it with your own computer, you can simply drag the files to be uploaded into BackupPan instead of the official client. Then it will be uploaded. After that you can delete them.
